        A characteristically "complex" and intricate style of electro house production which incorporates elements of dubstep and fidget house. The term was originally coined by Porter Robinson as a portmanteau of "complex" and "electro" in 2010, though there are earlier examples of this sub-genre.

        The main defining feature of complextro is the cut up bassline sections with heavy modulation, glitchy vocals, synth stabs, interweaving keyboard melodies and variety of sounds, cutting between instruments in quick succession. All of this is layered together over a driving electro house beat to produce the frantic and busy sound. The genre also typically has a gradual build-up similar to that of progressive house.

        Examples of artists that produce complextro include Wolfgang Gartner and the aforementioned Porter Robinson.
