        Electro house is a music genre characterized by heavy bass and a tempo around 130 beats per minute.[1][2] Its origins were influenced by tech house and electro.[3][4] The term has been used to describe the music of many DJ Mag Top 100 DJs, including Benny Benassi, Daft Punk, Skrillex, and Steve Aoki.[5][6][7]

      <p>
        Electro-house is typified by its heavy bass.[2] This is often in the form of buzzing basslines,[2] such as those created with sawtooth waves and distortion.[8] It is also often in the form of large bass drum sounds[2] in a four-on-the-floor pattern.[8] The tempo of electro house is usually between 125 and 135 beats per minute.[1] Electro house sometimes resembles tech house,[3] but it can contain melodic elements[1] and electro-influenced samples and synths.[3]

        The genre has been described as a fusion genre of house with electro â€“ either 1980s-style electro or its late-1990s revival, electroclash, which fused it with electropop and techno.[9][10] More recently, the word "electro" has been seen as an adjective that denotes "hard electronic dance music".[11]

        Early songs that have been labelled retroactively as electro house include "Dark Invader" by Arrivers in 1996 and "Raw S*it" by Basement Jaxx in 1997.[12] Mr. Oizo's 1999 hit "Flat Beat" has also been considered an early example of the genre.[13]

        Italian DJ Benny Benassi, with his track "Satisfaction" released in 2002, is seen as the forerunner of electro house who brought it to the mainstream.[10][4][14] By the mid 2000s, electro house saw an increase in popularity.[1] In November 2006, electro house tracks "Put Your Hands Up For Detroit" by Fedde Le Grand and the D. Ramirez remix of "Yeah Yeah" by Bodyrox and Luciana held the number one and number two spots, respectively, in the UK Top 40 singles charts.[15] Since then, electro house producers such as Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Porter Robinson, Yasutaka Nakata[16] and Dada Life have emerged.
